This is an on-going project as an assignment for the "Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D" on Udemy.
This is a quiz game to help me study for my school subjects. There are multiple choice questions with four choices. 
If you pick the wrong answer it highlights the right answer and also gives a message saying you chose the wrong answer.
If you pick the right answer it tells you that it's correct.
There is a 30 sec. timer for each question and 10 sec. timer for seeing the correct answer. If you make your choice before the time runs out, timer just skips.
After you see the correct answer it uploads the next question.
